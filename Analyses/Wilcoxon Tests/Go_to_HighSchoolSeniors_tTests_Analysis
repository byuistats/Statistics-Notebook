Your Wilcoxon Test analysis is contained inside your High School Seniors analysis 
in the t Tests section.

There, you are supposed to follow the instructions in Canvas:

1. Apply your peer feedback and improve your t Test analysis accordingly.

2. Add a section to the document that performs a Wilcoxon Test appropriate for
your data and discusses which test, the t Test or Wilcoxon Test, was more 
appropriate for your data and situation. Be sure to also state the hypotheses
for the Wilcoxon Test as they differ slightly from the hypotheses of the t Test.


Tabsets are a great way to introduce this second section.

Suppose you had performed an Independent Samples t Test previously like this:

## Analysis

```{r}
library(mosaic) #loads the KidsFeet data set
t.test(length ~ sex, data=KidsFeet) %>%
  pander(caption="Independent Samples t Test")
```

Then, you could expand your analysis section to include buttons for the t Test
and Wilcoxon Test using code like this:

## Analysis {.tabset .tabset-pills}

### t Test

```{r}
library(mosaic) #loads the KidsFeet data set
t.test(length ~ sex, data=KidsFeet) %>%
  pander(caption="Independent Samples t Test")
```

### Wilcoxon Test

$$
  H_0: new hypothesis for wilcoxon test
$$
$$
  H_a: new alternative for wilcoxon test
$$

```{r}
wilcox.test(length ~ sex, data=KidsFeet) %>%
  pander(caption="Wilcoxon Rank Sum Test")
```

##


Note that the "##" ends the tabset so that any content after the ## goes back
to the regular flow of the document rather than being hidden behind a button.


Good luck!
